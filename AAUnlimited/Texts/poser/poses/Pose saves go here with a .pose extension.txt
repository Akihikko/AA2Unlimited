A lot's changed in AAU's poser and that of course includes pose saving.
From now on this will be the poses directory to use.

To convert your old poses with the included pose converter simply select
them all in file explorer and drop them over the converter in this folder.
The compatible poses will be renamed and ready to be used while very old
pose saves will keep the original name.

To keep using old incompatible poses you must open them in AAUnlimited 0.4.5
and resave them to make them compatible with newer versions.
