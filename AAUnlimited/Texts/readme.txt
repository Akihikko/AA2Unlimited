Q: When i try to start AAUnlimitedExe.exe, it complains about missing MSVCRxx or VCRUNTIMEyyy (probably 140) missing
A: you need the vc++2015 redistributable packages. they are the c++ standard library from microsoft
	and are needed for every c++ program compiled with visual studio. Usually these would be installed
	with one of your other games, but 2015 is pretty new still, and game development takes time.
	you can get them here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True
	note: if you are on a 64-bit system, for some reason, you need both the 32-bit and the 64-bit version. no idea why, shouldnt be that way.

Q: Is this the new version? Where can i get the latest version?
A: There is a github for this project: https://github.com/aa2g/AA2Unlimited/releases
